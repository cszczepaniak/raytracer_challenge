# The Raytracer Challenge
This repo is me following along with [MrJakob's youtube series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy68GuC77sUTyOUvDhVboQoOlHoa4XrSO) where he walks through [The Raytracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/). I am also new to Rust, so I'm learning the language as I go.

## Running the Raytracer
To run any of the binaries, execute `cargo run --release --binary {binary name}`. You can find the available binaries in the `src/bin/` directory.

## Running the Tests
To run all the tests, simply run `cargo test`.
